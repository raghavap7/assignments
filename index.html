						<h3>Look at the Twitter screen above.Do you Think new users understand what they're supposed to do?</h3>
						<p>Go to Twitter.com or download the app and sign up for an account. The "Full name" that you provide will be your display name, but unlike Facebook, you can change your display name to whatever you want as many times as you want, so it's really easy to stay anonymous.
						Pick a username you like. That will be your handle, and people can bling you by typing @ in front of your user name in a tweet.
						Enter in your phone number. This is a form of authentication that will help in case you ever lose access to your account.</p>
						<p>Pick an avatar. The default picture is an egg, but you can make your avatar whatever you want (your face, a dog on a skateboard). Be sure to read Twitter's rules for avatar images to make sure what you pick is not in violation.
						Write your bio. You may wish to list where you work, live, or a line from a favorite poem in your bio. This is the short blurb that lets potential followers know who you are and what you're likely to tweet. Finish off your profile by uploading a background image—this appears at the top of your Twitter page.</p>
						<p>Twitter isn't about friending—it's about following. You can follow people you know personally, or artists or projects you're a fan of. You can follow robots and parody accounts. Really, you can do whatever you like.
						Once you create your account, Twitter offers a kind of set-up wizard to help you get started. If you're into wizards, follow the steps. It'll suggest some accounts to follow to get you started based on your interests.
						Twitter will ask if you want to search your email or phone contacts to find if anyone you know is also on Twitter.
						Search for personalities you like. If you're a fan of GZA, follow GZA. If you're a fan of the Golden State Warriors, follow Steph Curry. If you like to read WIRED, follow WIRED.
						Twitter will continue to offer suggestions for who to follow as you use it. These suggestions will appear in your feed if you're using the app, or on the side of the screen if you're using the website.</p>
